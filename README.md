I am Siddharth Chaini, a final year Master's student at IISER Bhopal, majoring in Physics.
I love to combine my passion for computer programming and data science with my background in physics and astronomy. I am chiefly interested in the following topics:

- Astroinformatics
- Time-Domain Astrophysics
- Data Science in Astronomy
- Supernova Cosmology

In my free time, I watch and play football, code for fun (automate the boring stuff!) and play role-playing video games!
