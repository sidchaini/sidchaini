I am Siddharth Chaini, a final year Master's student at IISER Bhopal, majoring in Physics.
I love to combine my passion for computer programming and data science with my background in physics and astronomy. I am chiefly interested in the following topics:

- Time-Domain Astronomy
- Astroinformatics
- Transients & Variable Stars
- Data Science in Astronomy

In my free time, I watch and play football, code for fun (automate the boring stuff!) and play role-playing video games.

Feel free to explore my repos, and also check out my webpage to know more about me: [siddharthchaini.github.io](https://siddharthchaini.github.io/?utm_source=github "Siddharth's Webpage").
