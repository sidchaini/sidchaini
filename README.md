I am Siddharth Chaini, an (Astro-)Physics PhD student at the University of Delaware, USA. My pronouns are he/him.

I love to combine my passion for computer programming and data science with my background in physics and astronomy. I am chiefly interested in the following topics:

- Transients and Time-Domain Astronomy
- Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics

In my free time, I watch and play football (soccer), code for fun (automate the boring stuff!) and play role-playing video games.

Feel free to explore my repos, and also check out my personal website to know more about me:
